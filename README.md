### About
This program is designed to read in the weekly payroll from Toast, calculate whether or not tipped employees are making minimum wage, and find the difference if not.

### Purpose
In the event that a tipped employee's wage, once combined with the amount of tips they received, falls below the amount they would have made if working for minimum wage without tips - then by law, the employer is required to pay the employee to make up for the difference.
